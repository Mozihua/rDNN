## Title
Toward an Interpretable Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic Model with Regional Abnormality Representation via Deep Learning



- We proposed a network that provides deep learning-based diagnosis and interpretability for Alzheimer's disease.
- We used a 1.5-T T1-weighted MRI dataset with images from 801 subjects from the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative).
- We pretrined our network with greedy layer-wise pretraining by first constructing stacked denoising auto-encoders (SDAEs) Vincent et al., 2010).

## Result
- We showed an accuracy of 89.22% for MCI vs. CN classification and an accuracy of 88.52% for pMCI vs. sMCI classification tasks.
